# Repository agent instructions

These instructions apply to the whole repository. More specific instructions in a nested `AGENTS.md` take precedence for files below that directory.

## Repository structure

- `frontend/` is the SvelteKit application for CV editing, API-backed persistence, compilation requests, and PDF preview.
- `backend/` is the single Rust/Axum crate containing the HTTP API and compilation worker binaries.
- `migrations/` contains the PostgreSQL migrations used by the backend.
- `docs/` contains maintained frontend and backend architecture plans and backlog notes.

## Product and design references

- Read `PRODUCT.md` before making product, workflow, scope, UX, accessibility, or user-facing behavior decisions.
- Read `DESIGN.md` before making visual, layout, typography, color, component, responsive, or motion decisions.
- Treat those files as the source of truth instead of copying their contents into this file. Preserve their constraints unless the user explicitly requests a change.

## Shared working rules

- Inspect `git status --short` and the relevant diff before editing. Treat existing staged, unstaged, and untracked changes as protected work.
- Work only in files relevant to the current task. Do not reset, restore, clean, overwrite, or remove unrelated changes.
- Keep patches narrow and preserve existing behavior unless the task explicitly requests a behavior change.
- Keep comments to a minimum. Add one only for ambiguous code, non-obvious intent, or a necessary tradeoff.
- Do not add secrets, `.env` files, dependencies, build output, test reports, logs, or generated screenshots to Git.
- Before reporting completion, run `git diff --check` and inspect `git status --short`.
- If a service is started manually on the host, stop it after the task and verify its port is free. Do not stop pre-existing or Docker-managed services without explicit permission.

## Frontend: `frontend/`

### Architecture

- Keep route entry points thin. Put workspace behavior under `frontend/src/lib/`.
- Keep generic leaf UI components under `frontend/src/lib/components/`.
- Keep workspace orchestration under `frontend/src/lib/workspace/`.
- Keep API code under `frontend/src/lib/api/`, composed through `createBackendApi()` in `frontend/src/lib/api/index.ts`.
- Use the domain API modules for authentication, CV sessions, documents, and compilation. Do not reintroduce a monolithic backend client.
- Keep one backend API instance per workspace so anonymous-session caching, authentication state, document context, and transport behavior remain shared.
- Keep `BackendPreviewAdapter` dependent only on document and compilation interfaces. Keep HTTP, authentication, and CV-session details out of preview and UI components.
- Preserve the backend wire contract: cookie credentials, bearer anonymous sessions, one-time `401` retry, snake/camel CV-session normalization, optimistic versions, `204` responses, and binary PDF artifacts.
- Keep workspace session persistence, conflict recovery, autosave scheduling, account orchestration, preview setup, and downloads in their dedicated services/helpers. Keep validation, section navigation, and reactive state in the workspace shell while feature components own markup.
- Keep reusable, presentation-level controls under `frontend/src/lib/components/base/`: `Button`/`ButtonLink`, form fields, `RadioCard`, and shared field error/accessibility helpers. Base controls own their labels, IDs, validation attributes, and native event/value forwarding while preserving the existing `.button`, `.cv-input`, `.field-error`, and related CSS vocabulary.
- Keep pure and browser-bound leaf helpers under `frontend/src/lib/utils/`. Filename/string normalization, blob downloads, and clipboard access belong there; feature services may compose them, but base components must not depend on workspace, API, compiler, or document state.
- Prefer the legacy-compatible Svelte component syntax already used by the frontend (`export let`, `bind:value`, and `on:` forwarding) until a migration explicitly adopts runes. Keep reusable controls independently importable through their base component paths or barrel export.
- Put feature components under feature-specific folders such as `components/workspace/` and `landing/`; keep route entrypoints and `Workspace.svelte` as orchestration shells. Workspace components own markup while the workspace shell retains state, validation, and service coordination.
- Use `components/base` for reusable controls and repeated UI patterns. Direct native controls are limited to base controls and specialized integrations such as CodeMirror and PDF canvas rendering.
- Keep shared pure/browser helpers in `frontend/src/lib/utils/`; leave CV fingerprinting/model logic under `cv/`, API serialization under `api/`, preview logic under `preview/`, and session/account/download orchestration under `workspace/`.

### Frontend commands

Run from the repository root:

```powershell
pnpm --filter @latex-renderer/frontend check
pnpm --filter @latex-renderer/frontend lint
pnpm --filter @latex-renderer/frontend test
pnpm --filter @latex-renderer/frontend test:e2e
pnpm --filter @latex-renderer/frontend build
```

For focused development, run the equivalent command from `frontend/` with `pnpm <script>`.

### Frontend testing expectations

- Add focused unit tests beside API, workspace, adapter, and controller behavior.
- Preserve deterministic Playwright backend fixtures; browser tests must not require a host XeLaTeX installation.
- When changing API paths or response shapes, update API tests, adapter tests, and affected browser fixtures.
- Preserve keyboard accessibility, responsive pane behavior, status announcements, diagnostics, and the last successful preview state.

## Backend: `backend/`

### Architecture

- Keep the backend as one Rust crate unless a boundary becomes independently reusable or deployable.
- Organize application code by feature. Current feature areas are `sessions`, `documents`, `cv`, and `compilation`.
- Keep feature models, routes, repositories, and services together. Routes handle HTTP translation, services own validation/authorization/use-case coordination, and repositories own PostgreSQL persistence.
- Use repository traits and the `Compiler` trait as explicit dependency-injection boundaries. Avoid abstraction layers without a concrete reuse or testing benefit.
- Keep `latex-renderer-backend` as the API binary, `latex-renderer-worker` as the queue worker, and `seed` as the explicit development seed binary.
- Preserve API semantics, authorization, optimistic CV-session versions, structured diagnostics, bounded artifact handling, and the `cv-xelatex` profile.
- Treat compiler execution as a security boundary: preserve `-no-shell-escape`, time/resource bounds, temporary workspace cleanup, bounded logs/artifacts, and disabled host compilation by default.
- Keep migrations backward-aware and verify database-version assumptions before changing schema or Compose configuration.
- When changing an endpoint or DTO, update the frontend API module and contract coverage in the same task when both are in scope.

### Backend commands

Run from the repository root:

```powershell
cargo fmt --manifest-path backend/Cargo.toml -- --check
cargo check --manifest-path backend/Cargo.toml --locked --all-targets
cargo test --manifest-path backend/Cargo.toml --locked
```

For local backend execution:

```powershell
Set-Location backend
cargo run --bin latex-renderer-backend
cargo run --bin latex-renderer-worker
```

For the database/API/worker stack, use the backend Compose project and its `.env` file:

```powershell
Set-Location backend
docker compose --env-file .env up -d --build
```

Host-side compilation requires explicit `LATEX_COMPILER_ENABLED=true` and a valid `LATEX_COMPILER_PATH`. The Compose worker image provides XeLaTeX and the CV fonts/packages; normal API and database tests should not require a host LaTeX installation.

### Backend testing expectations

- Add unit tests for validation, authorization, serialization, and service behavior.
- Add route/repository/integration coverage when changing persistence or HTTP contracts.
- Verify migrations and optimistic concurrency behavior for schema or CV-session changes.
- Exercise worker/compiler changes with bounded, deterministic fixtures where possible; do not make ordinary tests depend on a developer machine's TeX installation.

## Cross-layer changes

For changes spanning frontend and backend:

1. Identify the affected HTTP route, DTO, authentication/session behavior, and persistence boundary.
2. Update the backend implementation and tests first when the wire contract changes.
3. Update the owning frontend API module and adapter/workspace tests.
4. Run the relevant frontend and backend checks, then the broader suites when risk warrants it.
5. Document durable architecture or contract changes in `docs/` and keep `README.md` commands accurate.
