# Backend implementation plan

## Status

The first backend slice is implemented under `backend/`. It uses Rust, Axum, Tokio, SQLx, and PostgreSQL 19-compatible migrations. Redis is intentionally not used.

The service currently provides anonymous sessions, persisted projects/documents/revisions, PostgreSQL-backed compile jobs, structured diagnostics, artifact storage, health endpoints, and a separate worker binary. The Compose worker image includes XeLaTeX and the CV package/font set; host-side compilation remains disabled by default.

## Architecture

- `latex-renderer-backend` serves the HTTP API and runs database migrations.
- `latex-renderer-worker` claims jobs with PostgreSQL row locking and executes the compiler boundary.
- Source code is organized by feature: `sessions`, `documents`, and `compilation`.
- Each feature keeps its models, routes, repository, and service together. Repositories own SQLx persistence, while services own validation, authorization, and use-case coordination.
- Repository traits and the existing `Compiler` trait are the explicit dependency-injection boundaries. Concrete PostgreSQL repositories and services are composed in `lib.rs`; no workspace crates are needed yet.
- PostgreSQL generates UUIDv7 identifiers with `uuidv7()` and stores documents, jobs, diagnostics, and bounded PDF artifacts.
- The first compile profile is `cv-xelatex`; the worker invokes XeLaTeX with `-no-shell-escape`, bounded time, temporary workspaces, and cleanup.
- Redis is deferred until distributed queue or rate-limit requirements justify it.

### Backend source layout

    ├── model.rs
    ├── repository.rs
    ├── service.rs
    ├── compiler.rs
    ├── worker.rs
    └── routes.rs
```

The backend remains one crate. Additional workspace crates should be introduced only when a boundary becomes independently reusable or independently deployable.

## API boundary

- `GET /health/live`
- `GET /health/ready`
- `POST /api/v1/sessions/anonymous`
- `POST /api/v1/projects`
- `POST /api/v1/projects/{project_id}/documents`
- `GET /api/v1/documents/{document_id}`
- `PUT /api/v1/documents/{document_id}`
- `POST /api/v1/documents/{document_id}/compile`
- `GET /api/v1/compile-jobs/{job_id}`
- `DELETE /api/v1/compile-jobs/{job_id}`
- `GET /api/v1/artifacts/{artifact_id}`

Compile jobs return queued/running/succeeded/failed/cancelled states and structured diagnostics with optional file, line, and column locations. Successful jobs expose PDF artifact metadata and an authenticated artifact endpoint.

## Remaining backend work

- Add process/container resource enforcement beyond the application timeout.
- Add real cancellation of an active compiler process and bounded log capture.
- Add artifact retention cleanup and anonymous quota enforcement.
- Add deployment configuration, metrics, CI, and PostgreSQL integration tests.
- Continue frontend integration hardening, richer diagnostic navigation, and production deployment checks.
- Add password reset, email verification, MFA, and role-based administration only if the product requires them.

## Verification

Run from the repository root:

```powershell
cargo fmt --manifest-path backend/Cargo.toml -- --check
cargo check --manifest-path backend/Cargo.toml
cargo test --manifest-path backend/Cargo.toml
docker compose --env-file .env up -d
```

The `backend/compose.yaml` file uses the official PostgreSQL 19 Beta 2 image, the slim Rust API target, and a separate XeLaTeX-enabled worker target under the `latex-renderer` project name. Only the worker target contains TeX packages and enables compilation. PostgreSQL 19 remains pre-release, so this is for development and compatibility testing only. Beta 2 uses its own Docker volume because beta catalog versions are not directly compatible. The migration rejects servers below major version 19.
